/**
 * Use this to declare syscall number `num`, named `name`, accepting the given arguments. Also
 * defines _SYSC_N_`name` as `num`.
 *
 * Arguments are typed for convenience, but they are actually passed as `void*`.
 *
 * You don't want the syscall numbers to clash. All syscalls should be declared in a single file
 * (in chaOS it is `inc/syscalls.h`) to make errors more visible (you really want to notice this
 * before the compiler does).
 *
 * To implement the syscall, you need to define function `do_name` taking the specified arguments.
 * Userspace will have the call `name` available.
